# PlotCode
Code for demonstrating the 4-way interaction for "Motivated Numeracy" paper in R.

The 4-way interaction for the "Motivated Numeracy" paper (or lack thereof) is demonstrated using this ggplot2 code.  

It also demonstrates a lack of 3-way interaction between numeracy, political ideology, and problem type.  

The 3-way interaction would have been demonstrated if the Liberals had the probability correct 
for the liberal-confirming items always above the conservative-confirming items, the Conservatives had 
the probability correct for the conservative-confirming items always above the liberal-confirming items, 
and as numeracy increases the difference between those diverges for both Liberals and Conservatives.  
  
Apolitical items show the same trend as the political items (i.e., that as numeracy increases the probability correct increases).    
  
Moderates are shown for completeness.
